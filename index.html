			<h2>About</h2>
				<p>  Mary Wanesia is a Jeweler, an Arizona native, and a member of the Navajo tribe. She specializes in creating beautiful contemporary takes on the traditional adornments worn by Navajo in ceromonies and in daily life.</p>
			
				<p>	Jewelery in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Learn more.</a></p>
			
				<p>  Mary's jewelry has recieved recognition, and been featured in the National Museum of the American Indian, The New York Times Style Magazine, and Sedona Monthly. The collection has been sold all across the United States and been carried by the retail stores of Bergdorf Goodman. </p>
